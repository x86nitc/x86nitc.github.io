This project is an advanced level project for interested students completing the eXpOS project. While the aim of the eXpOS project is to make the reader familiar with concepts of an operating system by building one on top of a hypothetical machine XSM, the aim of this project is to build a basic operating system on the x86 architecture and hence one that can be run on modern day systems. This project, however, should not be taken up by people starting out on Operating System fundamentals as it does not provide an ideal foundation for core concepts.

For people taking up this project, it is important to realise that the amount of information and knowledge required for this project can be overwhelming. We have tried our best to keep the required concepts concise and to deliver them as and when required. Hence it is important that you follow this guide religiously in your initial phases without referring a lot externally as it is very easy to be lost. Once you have a fairly good picture of the system, you may feel free to explore more online. Below mentioned are some resources you will find increasingly helpful as you proceed through the stages.

* INTEL 80386 Progammer's Manual
* OSDev Wiki <https://wiki.osdev.org>

The reader is expected to have completed the Operating Systems and the Computer Organisation courses offered at NIT Calicut. Another important note is to not compare the x86 architecture to the XSM architecture all the time. While some things can be compared and understood easily faster, the x86 architecture is a lot more complex and has more steps involved for achieving certain things that might have been simply two or three lines of code in eXpOS. We have provided comparisons as we find fit hence following this guide will help you understand the architecture faster.
